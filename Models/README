This model was originally designed for the FlightGear flight simulator project
(http://www.flightgear.org). The Flight Dynamics Model (FDM) could be used by 
any software that makes use of the JSBSim FDM (http://www.jsbsim.org).

Some of the panel textures are (C) Martin "Pegasus" Schmitt who has
given his kind permission to use them as textures for this Model.
