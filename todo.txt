Stores
------
Model conformal fuel tanks.
Find real positions of payloads, is only approx. positions now.
Make id-0 be id-000, hmm not sure this is smart, not backwards compatible.
Should auto missile view work for jettisoned stores as well?
More gun tracers?
A-A and A-G button cycle cannon also?
Missile view start behind weapon?
Stores should only emergency Jett. when main, stby or epu is running.
Found a document that details all loadouts for US F16s, they can carry a lot more than Greek F16s.
Show stores over MP.
Add/edit payload quick selections as new weapons become available. Make it in a smarter way considering the number of them is becoming bigger every time?

Make center mount less deep, so pilot get good view of MFDs and RWR.

Make controls work for STORES CONFIG and STANDBY GAINS.
Enable masterarm, jettison, trims, ALT FLAPS and MFD contrast/brightness.
Enable knob for HUD focus. (above BRT knob)
Fuel dial strange (not really, one needle shows frw tank, one shows aft tank), but should be configurable.
